The Project Manager agent in Clean Coder automates task management using Todoist integration. It defines tasks, ensures execution, and handles testing based on project specifications. There is no need to run coding pipeline manually for every task any more!

## Run Manager

within your virtual environment, run:
```
python manager.py
```

### When running for a first time

When running Manager for the first time, it will ask you for a few variables, which it saves automatically in the .env file.

1. **API Keys**: Provide at least one API key for [Anthropic](https://www.merge.dev/blog/anthropic-api-key), [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key), or OpenRouter. Adding more keys ensures fallback options during LLM shortages.

2. **Directory Path**: Enter the full path to the directory where you want to write or modify code.

3. **Todoist API Key**: Provide your [Todoist API key](https://todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB).

4. **Coding Rules (Optional)**: Optionally, provide coding rules for your project. Learn more [here](/features/coderrules).

5. **Describe Your Vision**: On the first run, Manager will prompt you to describe your project in detail. Include as much information as possible.

<div style="background-color: #e6f4ea; border-radius: 15px; padding: 25px; margin: 20px 0; color: #111111;">
<strong>ðŸ”¥ Tips for a Good Project Description:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide a clear vision for each feature</li>
<li>Specify if tests and docs should be included</li>
</ul>
</div>

You can update the project vision anytime by editing the `.clean_coder/project_plan.txt` file in your project directory.

## Working with Manager

The Manager will create well-described tasks, including the Definition of Done, in your Todoist. For safety, you'll need to approve every task creation, modification, and deletion.

Once the Manager created complete list tasks for your project, it will use the `finish_project_planning` tool. First task from top will enter the programming pipeline.

You will collaborate with the Researcher, Planner, and Executor agents on each task. Completed tasks will be marked as done in Todoist, and you will be asked to provide feedback to the Manager on whether the task was executed well or needs improvements.

This process continues with tasks being executed one after another until the project is finished.
