description: How to make contributions to the Clean Coder
---

Contributions to the project are very welcome!

For small changes and bug fixes, feel free to submit them directly.

In case of major changes, please open an issue first or write your proposition on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8gat7Pv7QJ).

## Helpful tools:

To make development 10x faster: check out `non_src/tests/manual_tests`. Using scripts in this directory, you can run every agent separately without needing to run through the full pipeline. 

## Main rules to follow:

- Please submit your PRs to the `dev` branch.
- Prefer smaller PRs - better to have 3 small PRs than one big. Follow rule "one feature - one PR".
- Place into `src` folder things directly related to Clean Coder logic, and into `non_src` all the rest (tests for example).
