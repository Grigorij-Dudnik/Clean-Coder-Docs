title: Why Clean Coder?
description: Learn if Clean Coder is AI coder for you.

Wondering why you should choose Clean Coder when there are already a few other AI coding systems available on the market? Take a minute to read this doc. You will never switch to another system again.

## Dream

Our dream is to create a self-sufficient AI coder that allows you to rest on vacations or do something else while your code is written fully automatically.

That's why we're developing an AI coding framework that becomes more and more autonomous with every update.

## 4 key fields of improvement

To make Clean Coder as autonomous as possible (and to take minimum of your time to code something), we making it to excel on 4 main areas:

#### 1. Intelligence

The more intelligent your coding agent - the less time you need to spend to debug after him.

Clean Coder is likely the most intelligent AI coder available at the time of writing—its separate 2-step Planner agent carefully considers the logic and structure of your code before other agents write it into files. Most competitors have only single-step planner (architect) agents or no planning agent at all.

#### 2. Coding automations

The more advanced automations your agent has, the better it can debug itself—and the less time you'll spend debugging after him.

Clean Coder has many advanced automations, allowing AI better debug itself. Some of them are:

- [Frontend Feedback](/features/frontend_feedback) - allows AI to see the frontend it creates and itereatively improve it.

- Static analiser - provides AI with feedback about syntax mistakes, as bad indents or unused variables.

- Running python scripts - Clean Coder can execute Python scripts it has written to verify they run correctly.

#### 3. Codebase research

If your agent can't find the necessary pieces of code in your codebase, it won’t be able to work on the right code.

At the time of writing, Clean Coder has the most advanced codebase research system, capable of handling codebases of any size. This means even giant codebases are no problem for Clean Coder.

#### 4. Project management

If you really want your projects to be created autonomously, you need an AI that doesn’t just code single features but also organizes its own tasks.

While most other AI coders can only handle single tasks, Clean Coder includes a [Manager](/usage/manager) agent that organizes all project tasks in Todoist before coding them.
